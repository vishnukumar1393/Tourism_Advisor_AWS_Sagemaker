The Tourism Advisor system leverages machine learning to provide personalized travel recommendations based on user preferences such as trip type, mode of transport, budget, and number of days. This project utilizes AWS SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a predictive model that analyzes user input and suggests the most suitable tourism options. The dataset is custom-built and stored in AWS S3, while AWS Lambda is used to trigger the model for real-time predictions. The front-end interface allows users to enter their travel preferences and receive instant suggestions. This intelligent system enhances decision-making for travelers, ensuring efficient, personalized trip planning using scalable cloud-based AI services.
